### Introduction
This application uses deep learning to predict eye diseases from uploaded retinal images. 
The model uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture to efficiently classify different eye conditions.

**Types of Eye Diseases the Model Can Detect:**
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataract
- Age-related Macular Degeneration
- Normal

Upload a clear retinal image to get a prediction of the eye condition.
